I believe this project will be the first website I will build, using the format of a basic recipe website. More to come...
Skills that will be utilized include: 1)Use of VS Code, which I think is just a fancy text editor, 2)Interacting with git, a version control software 3)github, which is a cloud based VCS which is good for collaborating with a team, 4)Command line terminal, 5) basic html file structure, and 6) a well organized directory.
